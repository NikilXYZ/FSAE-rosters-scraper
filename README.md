# FSAE Rosters scraper
I wrote this in 2021 to help me recruit amazing talent for my startup.

FSAE racing teams are some of the only college organizations where students have to learn to build real functional products - in this case, functional (sometimes fully electric) race cars that don't explode!
I was on the Penn Electric Racing team (while we had the record for fastest accelerating electric car in the world, faster than Tesla), and the amount I learned in just a year was unparalleled.

## This repo has 2 components:
1. A tool to analyze the competition results PDFs and determine which teams have the top scores (creating a functional car and presenting it) in Python
2. A collection of JS scrapers for each of those high-quality teams' websites so that I could extract the roster and output a standardized JSON schema. This tool also includes a sub dataset compiling all those rosters, contact info of emails and linkedins which can then be loaded into a mail-merge tool like Apollo.io or others.

# This is how I found my eventual COO / Co-founder Annette
I emailed and linkedin messaged ~100 ppl who were all graduating in 2021 and she was one of the people who responded and passed the interview.
